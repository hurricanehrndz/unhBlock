# unhBlock

Block ads, malware, tracking + more on systems running Unbound as a resolver.

![unhBlock][unhblock-gif]

This project is based on [UnboundBL][unboundbl-link] and like it depends on
Unbound DNS to blackhole undesired content. unhBlock has been written with
maintainability in mind.

## Current Features

* Add, download and parse [blocklist URLs][blacklist-sample]
* Add, download and parse [whitelist URLs][whitelist-sample]
* Redirect to user defined IP address (i.e. pixelserv)
* Redirect to user defined CNAME record (i.e. pixelserv)
* Confirm valid Unbound configuration
* Optionally reload Unbound configuration

## Installation

### OPNsense

Use OPNsense branch.

1. Drop unhBlock in `/usr/home`
2. Drop [sample action][opnsense-action] file in `/usr/local/opnsense/service/conf/actions`
3. Edit action definition as needed
4. Drop [blacklist][blacklist-sample] sources file in `var/unhBlock/`
5. Drop [whiltelist][whitelist-sample] sources file in `/var/unhBlock`
6. Reload configd `service configd restart`
7. Test action `configctl unhBlock start`

## Recommended configuration

For best results redirect all domains found in blocklists to a host on your
network using a [PixelServ][pixelserv-link] via the `-b/--blackhole` flag.
Optionally redirect unwanted traffic employing a `CNAME` record via `--type
CNAME` option and parameter.

For my own personal configuration, I redirect all traffic to a PixelServ that is
reachable only via a [`Traefik`][traefik-link] router to support SSL.
Feel free to inspect the [sample service file].
